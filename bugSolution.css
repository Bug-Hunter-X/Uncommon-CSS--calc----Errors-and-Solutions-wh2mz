The solution involves ensuring consistent spacing and correct use of operators and units within the `calc()` function. Always adhere to the standard syntax to avoid unexpected behavior.  Here is the corrected code:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}

/*Example of using multiple units*/
.anotherElement {
  width: calc(50vw + 200px);
}

/*Avoid deeply nested calculations if possible*/
.nestedElement {
  width: calc(calc(100% - 50px) / 2);
}
```
By carefully following these guidelines, the CSS `calc()` function can be used effectively and reliably.
